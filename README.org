* /r/emacs Emacs-style

This makes =/r/emacs= look like the new GNU Emacs web site, which was designed by [[http://nicolas-petton.fr/][Nicolas Petton]]:

* To-do

A few items that need tweaking:

+ [ ] Subscribe/unsubscribe button
+ [X] Submitter username/flair
+ [ ] Login username/password box
+ [X] "Want to join?" box
+ [X] "My Subreddits" bar at the very top
+ [ ] A little white bar at the bottom of the footer (where did that come from?)

Lesson: Be sure to view without RES enabled...

Also, maybe:

+ Improved logo (where =M-x butterfly= is)

* License

This is just some CSS, and it's based on the GNU Emacs style.  I don't feel like a license is even necessary, but if you do, or if you need one, you may consider this licensed under the GPLv2, GPLv3, and/or MIT licenses, at your convenience.
