* /r/emacs Emacs-style

This makes =/r/emacs= look like the new GNU Emacs web site, which was designed by [[http://nicolas-petton.fr/][Nicolas Petton]]:

* To-do

Maybe:

+ [ ] Improved logo (where =M-x butterfly= is)

* License

This is just some CSS, and it's based on the GNU Emacs style.  I don't feel like a license is even necessary, but if you do, or if you need one, you may consider this licensed under the GPLv2, GPLv3, and/or MIT licenses, at your convenience.
